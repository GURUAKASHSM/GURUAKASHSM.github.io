TODO : * Need to Tell about Linked List

Basic Questions What I Figured Out:

Basic Linked List Concepts
1. What is a linked list? How does it differ from an array?
2. What are the components of a linked list?
3. What happens when the head of the linked list is null?
4. What are the basic operations you can perform on a linked list?
5. How do you traverse a linked list?
6. How do you reverse a singly linked list?
7. What is a cycle in a linked list?
8. What is the difference between a singly linked list and a doubly linked list?
9. Why is a linked list sometimes preferred over an array?
10. How do you find the length of a linked list?
11. What happens when you try to access an element of a linked list at an index out of bounds?

Types of Linked Lists
12. What are the types of linked lists? How do they differ from each other?
13. What is the difference between a singly linked list and a circular linked list?
14. What is a doubly circular linked list?
15. What is a multi-level linked list and how would you implement it?

Memory and Time Complexity
16. How does memory allocation for linked lists work?
17. What is the time complexity of operations on a linked list?
18. What is the time complexity of basic linked list operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, search)?
19. What is the time complexity of reversing a singly linked list?
20. How would you handle memory management in a linked list?

Operations on Linked Lists
21. How would you implement a stack or queue using a linked list?
22. How do you detect a cycle in a linked list?
23. How do you find the middle element of a linked list?
24. How do you remove duplicates from a linked list?
25. How would you merge two sorted linked lists?
26. How do you find the nth node from the end of a linked list?
27. How do you delete a node in a linked list when you only have access to that node (without access to the head)?
28. How would you split a linked list into two halves?
29. How do you reverse a linked list in groups of k?
30. How do you check if two linked lists intersect or overlap?
31. How would you rotate a linked list?
32. How would you detect and remove a cycle in a linked list?

Advanced Linked List Concepts
33. How would you implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a linked list?
34. How would you implement a queue using two stacks, and how is it related to linked lists?

Practical Use Cases
35. What are some real-world applications of linked lists?
36. How would you use a linked list to implement undo functionality in an application?
37. How would you implement a text editorâ€™s undo/redo system using a linked list?

Implementation Specific Questions
38. How would you implement a linked list in a language that doesn't have pointers (e.g., Java or Python)?
39. What would happen if you forget to update the next pointer during insertion or deletion?
